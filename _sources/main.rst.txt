Tool Description
-----------------


CLONESCAPER a lightweight yet practical code transformation approach that challenges recent ML-learning based clone detectors. In Clonescaper, we have developed 15 equivalence transformations (e.g., renaming variables, converting for-loop to while-loop, swapping code order, etc.).

To quickly find the workable solutions among all possible transformations, we adopt four diﬀerent strategies to search for eﬀective solutions, including All-Mutation (AM), Random-Mutation (RM), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).


Implementation Details
----------------------

To evaluate Clonescaper, we select unique code snippets from
the OJClone datasets. For a given code snippet *x*, we generate five semantic-preserved variants. We then iteratively pair *x*, with a variant and feed the code pair to ML-based detectors to see whether they can determine that pair as code clones. 

OJ is a C language database collected by Mou et al [#mou]_. It consists of 104 folders; each folder contains diﬀerent implementations of solutions of the same problem


We select around 20\% of the code from each OJClone task to form an initial dataset :math:`D_{I}`, and   apply the four strategies (AM, RM, GA, and MCMC) to :math:`D_{I}` to construct new datasets :math:`D_{A}`,  :math:`D_{R}`, :math:`D_{G}`, and :math:`D_{M}`. The original OJClone dataset has many redundant problem solutions and we only use the distinct solutions after careful inspection.

In the construction of the new dataset, we use the same code to generate the mutated code with   different strategies. That is, each strategy takes a  code C, and output a new  mutated code C' to form a code clone pair {C, C'}. Considering the random characteristics of RM, GA, and MCMC, we generate five instances of C' for each C. Therefore, :math:`size(D_{R}) \approx size(D_{G}) \approx size(D_{M}) \approx 5*size(D_{A})`.

+-------------+-------+---------+---------+---------+
|             |   AM  |    RM   |    GA   |   MCMC  |
+-------------+-------+---------+---------+---------+
| Clone Pairs | 10300 | 10394*5 | 10075*5 | 10395*5 |
+-------------+-------+---------+---------+---------+
| Time(m)     |  9.01 |  17.83  |  139.30 |  926.73 |
+-------------+-------+---------+---------+---------+

After obtaining the four new datasets, we feed them to the clone detector under test.  We define a metric named Escape Rate (ER) to assess the performance of the  ML-based detectors:     

.. math::
    ER =  \frac{\#Escaped\ CPs} {\#Total\ CPs} =  \frac {\#Total\ CPs - \#Reported\ CPs} {\#Total\ CPs}
