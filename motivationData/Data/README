data description

The data used in the paper motivation is saved here.

Here we transformed #1 in motivation using a randomized algorithm to generate a lot of equivalent clone codes and then tested it with three tools to find clone pairs that were not detected by any of the three tools.

OriginalChangedPair holds the corresponding clone pairs.
In the 142
1.c corresponds to #1 Original Code
2.c corresponds to #6 Mutated code


ProgramsDump corresponds to the unchanged original code.
ProgramsMutate is the code after the corresponding equivalent mutation.

The RandomEncodingResult holds the corresponding random codes.
