RQ1 experimental setup.
For the ML-based detectors(TBCCD,ASTNN,FCDector), to conduct fair comparisons, we adopt the best parameters reported in their papers . The only exception is FCDetector, on which we lower the epoch value to 100, instead of using the default value 10000, as the large epoch value (10000) does not bring much accuracy improvement but impose unbearable training cost.


RQ2 experimental setup.
 Let
us name the default dataset used by ML-based detector as $Data_O$ ,
and call the dataset generated by Clonescaper as ����� . Then,
����� =Clonescaper (����� , S), where S stands for the code mutation strategy. In this experiment, we use ����� +����� as the
new training data that ����� is the adversarial samples.
