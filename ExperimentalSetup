RQ1 experimental setup.
For the ML-based detectors(TBCCD,ASTNN,FCDector), to conduct fair comparisons, we adopt the best parameters reported in their papers . 
The only exception is FCDetector, on which we lower the epoch value to 100, instead of using the default value 10000, as the large 
epoch value (10000) does not bring much accuracy improvement but impose unbearable training cost.


RQ2 experimental setup.
We name the default dataset used by ML-based detector as DataO, and call the dataset generated by Clonescaper as DataM. Then, 
DataM =Clonescaper( DataO, S), where S stands for the code mutation strategy. In this experiment, we use DataO + DataM as the
new training data that DataM is the adversarial samples. 
We re-train the models of the ML-based detectors without altering any parameters. Without loss of generality, we augment the 
original training data with 80% of the adversarial samples to form the new training data and append the rest 20% of the 
adversarial samples into the existing testing data suite.
